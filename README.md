This is my pretty okay vim config. It's not written in Lua as the cool kids do these days, but if you add this the you `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and run `:PlugInstall` (and perhaps a cheeky `:UpdateRemotePlugins`) you'll have a pretty sweet Vim config which does almost everything you'll need.


# Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:svenhendrikx/okay-nvim-conf.git ~/.config/nvim

<in vim>
    :PlugInstall
    :UpdateRemotePlugins
    restart

```
